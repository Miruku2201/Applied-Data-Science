Projects 

LEGAL  SEAR CH   AN D  R ES PON SE  PLATFOR M   – Group competition project  

November 2023 - now 

●  Provides users with quick access to legal information, delivers reliable answers to legal queries, and enables efficient navigation 

through legal codes and documents 

●  Utilizes ReactJS for front-end development, employs Python Flask for back-end functionality, and enhances its capabilities with 

complementary integration tools such as CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) and Docker for streamlined 
deployment processes, ensuring efficient and reliable operation 

●  Project management, ensuring a waterfall system development process, data search and preprocessing, training deep learning 

models based on PhoBERT and LangChain for question-answering tasks for answering legal and training another model to classify 
"legal definition" sentences in legal documents, taking on the role of data designer using MySQL, and visualize the model training 
process for reporting using matplotlib 

●  Winning third prize in the Vietnam Student Informatics Olympiad - Open source competition, the project attracted the jury for its 
creativity and was considered to have the most potential. The product is open source code that is being invested in, developed 
and raised capital

Project 

●  Assisting users in automatically answering Vietnamese or English reading comprehension questions by providing the system with 

a passage of information (provided by the user), from which the system extracts information to answer the user's queries 
●  Using Hugging Face as a model repository, we employ a BERT-based model for answering English reading comprehension 

questions and a PhoBERT-based model for answering Vietnamese reading comprehension questions. Gradio is utilized to design 
an interactive interface for user interaction 
Taking on the role of data preparation, I utilize available datasets and scrape data from the web using BeautifulSoup4. Data 
processing is performed using Python, while model fine-tuning is carried out through the use of Transformers and PyTorch. 
Model evaluation and visualization of evaluation results are conducted using matplotlib 
The English question-answering model achieved a significant 78% accuracy when applied to multiple-choice questions. The 
Vietnamese question-answering model also achieved an exact match accuracy of 72%
